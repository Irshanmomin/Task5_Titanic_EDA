# Task5_Titanic_EDA
EDA on Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Objective:  
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover trends, relationships and patterns using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Steps Covered:
- Data loading and exploration (info(), describe())
- Handling missing values
- Univariate analysis (histograms, countplots)
- Correlation heatmap with insights
- Relationship analysis (pairplot & boxplots)
- Final summary of findings

Key Insights:
- Females and higher-class passengers had the highest survival rates  
- Higher ticket fares were positively linked with survival  
- 3rd class passengers and males had the lowest survival chances  
- Age showed a weak relationship with survival  

Tools Used:  
Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Jupyter Notebook
